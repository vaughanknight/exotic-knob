    - Why: The baseline exists to preserve raw HID evidence from the real adapter.
    - Contract: Bytes returned by HIDAPI are captured intact unless a descriptor
      proves a report ID should be split later.
    - Usage Notes: Report ID is 0 for the first baseline; payload contains all bytes.
    - Quality Contribution: Prevents capture corruption for unnumbered reports.
    - Worked Example: e900 remains e900, not 00.
