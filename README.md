**Tiny knob. Big stereo energy. Zero blown speakers.**

BluOS Knob is a local, safety-first volume knob for the **NAD M33** and other
**BluOS** players. It takes a tiny Anticater VK-01 Bluetooth knob and teaches it
some hi-fi manners: volume nudges, mute, source shortcuts, replayable hardware
captures, and guardrails that keep the party from turning into an accidental
speaker stress test.

Okay, technically it is "some script that sends volume commands" — but it is
some script that has had some thought put into it. It learns the real HID
reports from the knob, replays them deterministically, talks to BluOS over its
local API, and only changes the amplifier through harnessed commands with
explicit safety limits.

## What works today

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Anticater HID discovery | Lists the VK-01 HID interfaces on macOS via HIDAPI. |
| Live knob capture | Captures raw HID reports to JSONL fixtures. |
| Replay | Replays fixtures without hardware and emits normalized events. |
| Gesture learning | Volume up/down, mute, hold-rotate brightness reports, and release/no-op reports are identified. |
| BluOS/NAD probing | Reads `/Status`, `/SyncStatus`, and `/Volume` from a NAD M33. |
| Guarded live commands | Supports bounded dB steps, explicit mute on/off, and guarded source switching. |
| Safety harness | Named `just` commands, tests, lint, boundary checks, smoke checks, and live readbacks. |
| Daemon loop | Runs the knob-to-BluOS loop so the VK-01 controls the NAD directly. |

## Current gesture plan

| Anticater event | Intended action |
|---|---|
| `volume_up` | Raise NAD volume by a bounded dB step. |
| `volume_down` | Lower NAD volume by a bounded dB step. |
| `mute_toggle` | Toggle or explicitly set BluOS mute through policy. |
| `brightness_down` / hold-rotate down | Switch to **Optical 1** via `inputTypeIndex=optical-2`. |
| `brightness_up` / hold-rotate up | Resume **Spotify** via `Spotify%3Aplay`. |
| release/no-op | Do nothing. |

Source switching sets a post-switch safety target of **`-40 dB`**. Positive
volume steps are guarded by a configured maximum, currently tested with
**`-24 dB`** as the loudness ceiling.

## Get started

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python3 -m bluos_knob.cli.main --help
python3 -m bluos_knob.cli.main replay --fixture tests/fixtures/anticater/sample_reports.jsonl
```

## Anticater hardware harness

Pair/connect the knob through the operating system first. The CLI does not do
Bluetooth pairing and does not attempt LED/RGB control.

```bash
just setup-hid
just doctor-hid
just list-devices
just capture-gestures
```

Direct capture is also available:

```bash
python3 -m bluos_knob.cli.main capture \
  --path "<path from just list-devices>" \
  --output capture.local.jsonl \
  --operation-label live-probe
```

The `DevSrvsID` path can change after sleep or reconnect. Re-run
`just list-devices` when in doubt.

`*.local.jsonl` captures can contain local HID paths or serials. Review and
redact local identity fields before sharing or committing fixtures.

## BluOS / NAD harness

Set the NAD/BluOS host explicitly; local IPs are not hardcoded into the app.

```bash
export BLUOS_HOST=192.168.1.67
just bluos-doctor
just bluos-status
just bluos-syncstatus
just bluos-volume
```

Guarded mutation harness:

```bash
just bluos-step-down 192.168.1.67 1 -24
just bluos-step-up 192.168.1.67 1 -24
just bluos-mute-off 192.168.1.67
just bluos-mute-on 192.168.1.67
just bluos-sources 192.168.1.67
just bluos-source-optical 192.168.1.67
just bluos-source-spotify 192.168.1.67
```

Important safety notes:

- There are no unbounded volume commands.
- Mutating commands require explicit acknowledgement flags inside the scripts.
- Source switching sets `abs_db=-40` after switching.
- Spotify is a service/play context, not a passive `inputTypeIndex` source.
- Optical 1 is, delightfully, `inputTypeIndex=optical-2`.

## Daemon

Run the live knob-to-BluOS loop:

```bash
just daemon-dry-run
just daemon
```

The daemon maps knob events to the same guarded BluOS commands:

| Knob event | Daemon action |
|---|---|
| `volume_up` | `+1 dB`, refused above the configured max dB. |
| `volume_down` | `-1 dB`. |
| `mute_toggle` | Query current mute, then send explicit mute on/off. |
| `brightness_down` | Switch Optical 1 and set `abs_db=-40`. |
| `brightness_up` | Resume Spotify and set `abs_db=-40`. |

The daemon auto-discovers the current Anticater HID path, which can change after
sleep/reconnect, and logs what it does:

```bash
tail -f /tmp/bluos-knob-daemon.log
```

## Checks

```bash
just test
just lint
just smoke
just doctor-hid
```

If `just` is unavailable, run the commands from `justfile` directly.

## Roadmap

- Promote redacted real Anticater gesture fixtures.
- Add richer config for step dB, max dB, source shortcuts, and group behavior.
- Package the daemon for local startup.
